    "Based on the kaggle challenge [Airbus Ship Detection Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbus-ship-detection/overview). This challenge uses satellite images to detect if a image has ships and draw a box (mask) around the ship. This challenge contains ~40GB of data and the training size is a little out of scope for this project, so we approaching it with two goals:\n",
    "1. Training a binary classifier to classify images that contain ship(s)\n",
    "2. Explore the state-of-the-art approach to this model, U-Net\n",
    "    - Goal is to follow the baseline notebook submission and understand the architechure. "
